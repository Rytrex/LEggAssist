#L.Egg Assist
This calculator was make to calculate whether or not you should transfer or catch more of a Pokemon before using your Lucky Egg to evolve Pokemon for experience.

#Calculations
This calculator uses the information you give to calculate a number which recommends you catch or transfer X Pokemon. The calculation is as follows: (Candy - (NumOfPokemon * (EvolutionAmount - 1) + 1)) / 3. This is because when you evolve a Pokemon, you get +1 Candy. The game treats that Pokemon as a transfer. If the number is negative, the value above is floored; else, take it's ceiling.

#Planned Updates
~~Some people transfer Pokemon as they are evolving. I want to add a toggle that will accomidate for that in the calculations.~~
This has been added, but the calculations need a small amount of work.
